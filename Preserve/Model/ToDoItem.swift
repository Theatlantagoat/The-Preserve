//This Object is a struct that consists of the properties for a To Do item.  A to do item has four properties: a title, an item description, a timestamp, and a location
//The title, itemdescription, and timestamp will be standard swift library types
//The location will be a custom object that uses the core location framework using CLLCoordinates
//This is the parent object which will serve as the blueprint where children are formed as each separate To Do Items
